Test Cases:

Valid inputs:
1. Input = "",  Expected Output = 0
2. Input = "1,5", Expected Output = 6
3. Input = "-2, 4, 0", Expected Output = 2
4. Input = "-99 , 99", Expected Output = 0

Invalid Inputs:
1. Input: Pass integer or any other datatype as inputs. Output: Throw exception that string is required.
Eg: Input: 1,2.  Output: Exception that string is needed
Update: this will now be taken care of as part of trying to convert the input to integer array.
2. Input: Pass a string, but pass something that cannot be parsed into integer array. Output : Exception with "A list of integers within string is required"
Eg: Input 1,2.  The dot at the end is wrong, so exception will be thrown.
